My name is David Calvert, I'm a Site Reliability & Platform Engineer working remotely from the south of France.\
With over 12 years of experience across large-scale and business-critical systems, I’ve built reliable and observable platforms using cloud, on-prem and hybrid architectures. I now focus on creating internal tools and developer platforms that improve reliability, scalability and engineering productivity as a Staff Site Reliability & Platform Engineer.
